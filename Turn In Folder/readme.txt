./Software/ contains our source code and executable

Python source code can be found in ./Software/Components/ and ./Software/Database/, as well
as in ./Software/serverstart.py. HTML source code can be found in ./Software/templates/. CSS
& JavaScript source code can be found in ./Software/static/. Other relevant files you might 
want to look at are, current_game_state.json, initial_game_state.json, league_stats.json, 
and match_history.json. These files can be found in the Software directory, and are used 
alongside a SQL database to store persistent data and faciliate gameplay.
